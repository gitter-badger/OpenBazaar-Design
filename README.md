This is a design prototype by @morebrownies for OpenBazaar.

It is meant to be basic HTML only and is split into components using Polymer.

### Development

Run any static HTTP server in the root directory to run (file:/// urls will not work).

For example:

```
bower install
npm install -g static-server
static-server .
```

### Running in Electron

OpenBazaar-Design runs in Electron using `electron-prebuilt` via npm.

```bash
bower install
npm install
npm run start
```
